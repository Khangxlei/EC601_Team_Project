# Stock Market Prediction Using RNN

## Project Description

This project utilizes recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to predict stock prices by analyzing a comprehensive set of features, including fundamental market data, macroeconomic indicators, and technical factors. The model aims to capture the complex, volatile, and nonlinear behavior of stock markets, providing predictions based on historical data from platforms such as NASDAQ, NYSE, Nikkei, and FTSE. Additionally, the project integrates sentiment analysis from news headlines and Google Trends data to offer a more holistic view of market sentiment and enhance the predictive accuracy.

The goal is to create a user-friendly tool that allows users to input a date range for stock purchases and sales predictions, while also comparing data across multiple sources for better decision-making.

## Target Users

1. **Stock Investors**:  
   Investors who seek data-driven insights to predict stock price movements based on historical and technical data. This tool aims to optimize buying and selling strategies in volatile markets.

2. **RNN Researchers**:  
   Academics and researchers in the fields of machine learning and finance can use this tool to compare the RNN model's predictions with other forecasting models, contributing to advancements in quantitative finance and stock market forecasting.

## User Stories

- **Stock Investor**:  
  As a stock investor, I want to input a date range for my potential stock transactions so that I can receive predictions on expected stock price movements and make informed buying and selling decisions.

- **Academic Researcher**:  
  As an academic researcher, I want to compare this model's predictions with other forecasting methods to evaluate its effectiveness and contribute insights to quantitative finance research.

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

The MVP will include:

- A simple user interface where users can input a date range for stock predictions.
- The model will generate stock price predictions based on historical data from sources such as NASDAQ, NYSE, Nikkei, and FTSE.
- The tool will display and compare data sources, helping users evaluate trends from multiple stock markets.
